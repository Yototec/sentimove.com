# Stellar Space

An immersive 3D space visualization with stars and constellations.

## Features

- Randomly generated star field with twinkling effect
- Slowly moving stars to create a dynamic universe
- Random constellation formation with connecting lines
- Camera movement controlled by mouse position at screen edges

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Move your mouse to the edges of the screen to navigate the space:
   - Top edge: Look up
   - Bottom edge: Look down
   - Left edge: Look left
   - Right edge: Look right

## Implementation Details

This project uses only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a 3D space environment. It implements:

- CSS 3D transforms for the space visualization
- Dynamic star generation with random properties
- Procedural constellation creation
- Camera movement based on mouse position

No external libraries or frameworks are required.
